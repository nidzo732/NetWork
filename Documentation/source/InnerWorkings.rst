Inner workings of the NetWork framework
***************************************

This document describes how NetWork works internaly. You don't need to read this document to use NetWork properly but if you want to know more about NetWork or if you want to help in development the contents of this document could be useful.

Basic structure of the network
##############################

The workgroup in NetWork is made of one master computer and one or more worker computers.  Workers run a server program that receives instructions from the master. When that server starts it listens on port **32151** and waits for master to register.
When an instance of Workgroup is created the constructor is given a list of IP addresses. 

The constructor sends a test code (:py:const:`NetWork.networking.COMCODE_CHECKALIVE`) to each of the given IPs and waits for response, when the server program on the worker receives the test code it responds with a return code (:py:const:`NetWork.networking.COMCODE_ISALIVE`), if all goes well and the codes are received the worker is added to the workgroup.

Once the workgroup starts working the master computer manages all communication, worker computers can't communicate between themselves. All multiprocessing tools send request to the master when used on worker computers.

Low level networking
####################

NetWork relies heavily on network communication. Classes used for networking are defined in :py:mod:`NetWork.networking`.

When communicating all parts of the framework use the :py:class:`NetWork.networking.NWSocket` class, this class is set to the default socket class in NetWork (currently that's :py:class:`NetWork.networking.NWSocketTCP`). 

The default class can be changed to adapt to various types of networks, but all networking classes must implement certain methods and must be self contained, when adapting to another network, no part of NetWork should be changed but the :py:mod:`NetWork.networking module`.

All socket classes must have these methods and members:

:NWSocket:
  
  listen : method
    Start listening for incoming connections, after call to this method the socket must be ready to accept requests. There is no bind method, binding must be done automaticaly by the class.

  accept : method
    Accept a new request, return an instance of a socket class that will be used to receive and respond to that request.

  connect(address) : method
  	Connect to given address, addres can be any object, anything given to the Workgroup constructor is passed directly to the connect method

  send(data) : method
    Send given data to the other side. All data must be handled safely, no buffer overflows, no parital messages. There won't be two sends on the same socket. Usually one message is sent, a response is received and the socket is closed.

  recv : method
    Receive all data sent from the other side. All data must be handled safely, no buffer overflows, no parital messages. Messages have variable length, it is the responsibility of the socket class to know that length and receive the entire message.

  close : method
    Close the socket, it will no longer be used for communication.

  address : member
  	The address of the remote computer to whitch this socket is connected to, used to identify which worker sent the request.

  checkAvailability(address) : static method
  	Check if a worker is present at the given address. This method is called on startup when adding workers.

Any class implementing these methods can be used in NetWork, just change the default class to your own

:py:class:`NetWork.workgroup.Workgroup` internals
#################################################


:py:meth:`__init__`
-------------------
When a new instance is created the constructor goes through the given list of IPs, for each of thos IPs it tries to create an instance of :py:class:`NetWork.worker.Worker` class, the worker uses :py:func:`NetWork.networking.NWSocket.checkAvailability` to test if the IP is valid, if all goes well without exception the worker is added to the workgroup.

After the workers are added initialization is done on other modules (:py:mod:`NetWork.event`, :py:mod:`NetWork.manager`...) their internal variables (:py:data:`runningOnMaster`, various dictionaries of items etc) are set to their apropriate initial values.

Dispatcher, Listener, :py:data:`commqueue` and commands
-------------------------------------------------------
The workgroup has two internal threads (or processes, this can change) that run in the background to receive requests from workers and from the main program that runs on the master computer and uses this Workgroup. These processes don't start during :py:meth:`__init__`, they are run manualy using the :py:meth:`startServing` method and are stoped with :py:meth:`stopServing`.

networkListener
===============
Listener has a server socket that listens on port **32151** and accepts requests from the workers, for each new connection it starts a thread that receives the actual request and sends it through the :py:data:`commqueue` to the dispatcher process.

dispatcher
==========
Dispatcher is one of the most important part of the workgroup, all IPC and concurrency control tools are handled by dispatcher. The dispatcher receives requests through the :py:data:`commqueue`.

Requests begin with a 3 letter code that determines their handler function. The dispatcher looks for handler functions in :py:data:`NetWork.handlers.handlerList`, a dictionary that maps the 3 letter codes to their handlers, once the handle function is found the dispatcher runs it and gives it the request.

commqueue
=========
Commqueue is a queue created during :py:meth:`__init__` and is used to pass commands to the dispatcher. All requests are passed through this queue, when tasks on workers use a tool it sends a message to :py:attr:`networkListener` and it passes it via :py:attr:`commqueue` to the dispatcher. Tools on the master put their requests directly to this queue.

Command
=======
Command is a class used to pack requests that are passed to the dispatcher, in addition to the request itself the Command also has additional data:
  
  * ID number of the worker who sent the request, if the request was sent from the master the ID is -1
  * if the request was sent from the worker a socket is also passed to the dispatcher and the handler, this way the handler can respond to the request if needed
  

Controlls
---------
Controlls is a manager used internaly in the Workgroup, it contains various properties like list of workers, nubmer of registered queues etc. It is used because dispatcher and listener need to access this shared data.

Communication with workers
##############################
Each worker in the workgroup is represented with an instance of :py:class:`NetWork.worker.Worker` class, these objects are used to control the workers. Workes have methods that are used for controling tasks and using IPC and concurrency control tools, they also have generic :py:meth:`sendMessage` and :py:meth:`sendMessageWithResponse` methods used to pass messages to the workers.

Passing requests
################
Most of the functionality of NetWork relies on passing requests, over the network and through the :py:data:`commqueue` to the dispatcher.

These requests have to be identified and handled by a proper handler function. To identify them 3-letter codes are prepended to each request, the codes are defined in :py:mod:`NetWork.commcodes`. Every code has its handler function.

When a request is received (in dispatcher or on the worker server) a dictionary (:py:data:`NetWork.handlers.handlerList` for dispatcher, :py:data:`server.handlers` on worker) is searched for the appropriate handler function.

Multiprocessing tools
#####################
Despite serving difrent purposes all multiprocessing tools have some common properties. 
Each instance of a tool has its own integer ID, every queue, lock, manager or event has its own ID. When requests are sent to the dispatcher an ID is also sent to identify which item is used.

They are all created with :py:meth:`Workgroup.register*` methods - :py:meth:`registerQueue`, :py:meth:`registerLock`...

Most of them also have local dictionaries containing stuff that is used to handle them localy, for example - for every :py:class:`NWQueue` an instance of :py:class:`multiprocessing.Queue` is added to :py:data:`NetWork.queue.queues` dictionary on every computer in the workgroup, and the position of those queues in the dictionary is determined by the ID of the particular :py:class:`NWQueue`.

Events
------
Registration
============
Events are created with :py:meth:`Workgroup.registerEvent`, when it's called a register event command is put on the :py:data:`commqueue` and the handler sends a register event message to all workers, along with the message an event ID is passed. On the workers and on the master a new instance of :py:class:`multiprocessing.Event` is added to :py:data:`NetWork.event.events` dictionary.

Waiting
=======
The :py:meth:`NWEvent.wait` method looks the same on both the master and the worker, it simply runs wait method of the apropriate event in :py:data`NetWork.event.events` dictionary.

Set
===
Set is different depending on whether it's run on master or the worker. On the master it passes set event mesage allong with the ID through the :py:data:`commqueue`, on the worker it connects to the listener on the master and send it the message.

In both cases the dispatcher receives the message through the :py:data:`commqueue`, it sends set event message to all workers and sets the local event on the  master.

Locks
-----
Registration
============
Locks are created with :py:meth:`Workgroup.registerLock`, when it's called a register lock command is put on the :py:data:`commqueue` and the handler sends a register lock message to all workers. On the master a new instance of :py:class:`NetWork.lock.MasterLockHandler` is added to :py:class`NetWork.lock.lockHandlers` dictionary. On the master and the workers, a new instance of :py:class:`multiprocessing.Lock` is added :py:data:`NetWork.lock.locks` dictionary, after that it's acquired.

:py:class:`MasterLockHandler`
=============================
A class that is used on the master to hold information about locks, each lock has one. It has a boolean value telling whether the lock is locked and it has a list of waiters that tried to acquire the lock when it was locked.

Acquiring
=========
When :py:meth:`NWLock.acquire` is called it sends a message to the dispacher (through the network if on worker or through the :py:data:`commqueue` if on master) that it wants to acquire the lock, after that it runs the acquire method on the apropriate lock in :py:data:`NetWork.lock.locks`.

When dispatcher receives the message it check apropriate :py:class:`MasterLockHandler` in :py:data:`NetWork.lock.lockHandlers`, :py:class:`MasterLockHandler` has a boolean value telling whether its locked. If it is not locked, a release lock message is sent to the worker that tried to acquire the lock, when the message is received the appropriate lock in :py:data:`NetWork.lock`.locks is released and the process that called acquire on it continues its work. 

If the master called acquire and the lock is unlocked then a lock in :py:data:`NetWork.lock.locks` on the master is released. 

If :py:class:`MasterLockHandler` is locked the requester ID is added to the waiting list until the lock is released.

Releasing
=========
A message is sent to the dispatcher (network or :py:data:`commqueue`) to release the lock. When releasing it checks the waiter list in :py:class:`MasterLockHandler`, if there are waiters it gets the ID of the first one, if the ID is -1 (master ID) the local lock on :py:data:`NetWork.lock.locks` is released for other IDs a message is sent to the worker to release the lock, when the worker receives the message it releases the required lock.

Managers
--------
Registration
============
Managers are created with :py:meth:`Workgroup.registerManager`. A message is sent through the :py:data:`commqueue` and a new   :py:class:`multiprocessing.manager.dict` is added to :py:data:`NetWork.mananager.managers` on the master, no registration is performed on the workers.

Setting items
=============
When :py:meth:`NWManager.setItem` is called a request is sent to the dispatcher (network or :py:data:`commqueue`) with the manager ID, item key and the new value, when the dispatcher receives the message it sets that item to a new value on the local manager in :py:data:`NetWork.manager.managers`

Getting items
=============
If :py:meth:`NWManager.getItem` is called on the master it simply reads it from :py:data:`NetWork.manager.managers`. If it's called on the worker it sends the request over the network and the dispatcher responds with the value of that item through the same socket.

Queues
------
Registration
============
Queues are created with :py:meth:`Workgroup.registerQueue`, a message is sent through the :py:data:`commqueue`. On the master and the workers a new instance of :py:class:`multiprocessing.Queue` is added to :py:data:`NetWork.queue.queues` dictionary. On the master a new instance of :py:data:`NetWork.queue.MasterQueue` handler is added to :py:data:`NetWork.queue.queueHandlers`.

:py:class:`MasterQueueHandler`
==============================
A class that is used on the master to hold information about queues, each queue has one. It contains two lists, :py:attr:`items` and :py:attr:`waiters`. When an item is put on the queue it's added to the items list, when get is called the requester is added to the waiters list. :py:class:`MasterQueueHandler` has a distribute method that check these lists and if both items and waiters are available it sends the first available item to the first waiter.

Getting items
=============
The worker (or master) sends a get request allong with the queue ID and calls get on the local queue. The dispatcher receives request, adds the worker to the waiter list and calls :py:meth:`distribute`.

Putting items
=============
A put item request is sent to dispatcher (network or :py:data:`commqueue`), it adds that item to the item list on the appropriate :py:class:`MasterQueueHandler`, after adding the item it calls its :py:meth:`distribute` method.

Distribution
============
If the waiters and items list of py:class:`MasterQueueHandler` are not empty it sends the first item from the items list to the first worker on the waiters list, the worker receives the item and puts it to an aprropriate queue in :py:data:`NetWork.queue.queues`, it the waiter is master dispatcher just puts the item on a local queue in :py:data:`NetWork.queue.queues`.
