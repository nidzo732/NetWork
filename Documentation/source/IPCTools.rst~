IPC and concurrency control tools
*********************************
One of the main advantages of NetWork are IPC and concurrency control tools that behave just like their equivalents used for multiprocessing on single computer.
The tools are simple to use, you don't have to wory about network communication and low level stuff, just use them like you're running on a single computer.
The only difference with these tools is that you don't create them directly like ordinary classes but you use the methods of the :py:class:`Workgroup <NetWork.workgroup.Workgroup>`.

Here are the tools currently available

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   Manager <NetWork.manager>
   Event <NetWork.event>
   Lock <NetWork.lock>
   Queue <NetWork.queue>
  
To create these tools use the :py:class:`Workgroup <NetWork.workgroup.Workgroup>`'s registration methods.

* :py:meth:`registerManager <NetWork.workgroup.Workgroup.registerManager>` for managers

* :py:meth:`registerEvent <NetWork.workgroup.Workgroup.registerEvent>` for events

* :py:meth:`registerLock <NetWork.workgroup.Workgroup.registerLock>` for locks

* :py:meth:`registerQueue <NetWork.workgroup.Workgroup.registerQueue>` for queues
