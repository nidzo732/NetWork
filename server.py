"""
This program runs on worker computers and waits for requests from the master.
It is responsible for running tasks and passing them data sent from the master.

When it starts, it waits for the first message from the master, which should
be COMMCODE_CHECKALIVE and it responds with COMCODE_ISALIVE.
Once the master is registered the mainloop starts receiving messages
from the master. The messages start with a 3 letter code that determines
their type, the mainloop reads that code and runs a handler function associated
with that code. Core message codes can be seen in NetWork.commcodes.
