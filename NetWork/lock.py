"""
Locks are used to prevent simultaneous execution of taks
that would interfere with each others work if the ran simultaneously.

When a task enters a critical section of code, it calls :py:meth:`acquire <NWLock.acquire>`
method of the lock. If another task tries to acquire the same lock, it will be
put to sleep. When the first task finishes the critical section it calls 
:py:meth:`release <NWLock.release>` method of the lock and waiting task is waken up.

For more info about locks see `Python documentation page <http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/threading.html#lock-objects>`_

    #Demonstration of Locks
    #Two running tasks check if an int variable called number should be incremented
    #If another task incremented the variable before, it would set
    #the shouldIncrease item in the manager to false
    #But because the tasks run at the same time, during the check
    #they could both see that shouldIncrease is False and they would
    #both increment number
    #Unless we use lock and put the acquire and release call around the
    #code that checks and increments number
    
    def checkAndIncrement(manager, lock):
        lock.acquire()    #Make sure another tasks are not checking at the same time
        if manager.shouldIncrease:
            manager.shouldIncrease=False
            manager.number+=1
        lock.release()
    
    with Workgroup(addresses) as w:
        lock=w.registerLock()
        manager=w.registerManager()
        namespace=manager.namespace()
        namespace.shouldIncrement=True
        namespace.number=0
        task1=w.submit(target=checkAndIncrement, args=(namespace, lock))
        task2=w.submit(target=checkAndIncrement, args=(namespace, lock))
        time.sleep(2)    #Give them time to run
        print(namespace.number)    #This prints '1' but if we didn't use locks
                                   #if might have printed '2'
