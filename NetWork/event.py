"""
Events are used to enable taks to signal each other that an event has
occured. For example, a task that needs some data generated by another task
can wait for an event signaled by that task. The waiter process calls the :py:meth:`wait <NWEvent.wait>`
method of the event and is put to sleep. When another task call the :py:meth:`set <NWEvent.set>` method
of the same event the first task is waken up and continues it's work

    #Usage examplu
    #Prints "Event has been raised" after 5 seconds

    with Workgroup(addresses) as w:
        myEvent=Event(w)
        myTask=w.submit(target=waiter, args=(myEvent,))
        sleep(5)
        myEvent.set()
        sleep(1)    #Dont kill workgroup until the message is sent to worker
